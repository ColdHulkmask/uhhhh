      <p>A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program or software application. The term "app", short for "software application", has since become very popular even winning word of the year in 2010</p><br>

      <p>Apps are broadly classified into three types: <a href="#native">native apps</a>, <a href=#hybrid>hybrid</a> and <a>web apps</a>. Native applications are designed specifically for a mobile operating system, typically iOS or Android. Web apps are written in HTML5 or CSS and typically run through a browser. Hybrid apps are built using web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML 5 </p><br>
      <h2>Native apps</h2>
      <p id=native>All apps targeted toward a particular mobile platform are known as native apps. Therefore, an app intended for Apple device does not run in Android devices. As a result, most businesses develop apps for multiple platforms.<br>
      While developing native apps, professionals incorporate best-in-class user interface modules. This accounts for better performance, consistency and good user experience. Users also benefit from wider access to application programming interfaces and make limitless use of all apps from the particular device. Further, they also switch over from one app to another effortlessly.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid apps</h2>
      <p id="hybrid">A web-based app is implemented with the standard web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Internet access is typically required for proper behavior or being able to use all features compared to offline usage. Most, if not all, user data is stored in the cloud.<br>
      The performance of these apps is similar to a web application running in a browser, which can be noticeably slower than the equivalent native app. It also may not have the same level of features as the native app.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid apps</h2>
      <p id="hybrid">The concept of the hybrid app is a mix of native and web-based apps. Apps developed using Apache Cordova, Xamarin, React Native, Sencha Touch, and other frameworks fall into this category.<br>

      These are made to support web and native technologies across multiple platforms. Moreover, these apps are easier and faster to develop. It involves use of single codebase which works in multiple mobile operating systems.<br>

      Despite such advantages, hybrid apps exhibit lower performance. Often, apps fail to bear the same look-and-feel in different mobile operating systems.</p>
